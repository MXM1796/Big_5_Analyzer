21,This morning has been exciting.,88.35,1.32
22,It's been a bit of a rush.,89.67,0.99

25,just to check what the weather was doing.,94.14,1.56
26,It was about 20 minutes before sunrise,95.7,1.59
27,"and I didn't know if it
was gonna be rained out,",97.29,2.25
28,and there was a cloud inversion,99.54,1.47
29,in the mountains this morning.,101.01,1.11

32,"It is so beautiful and

33,It feels like I'm sitting up in a cloud.,110.91,2.01
34,There's patches of fog among the hills,112.92,1.95
35,and we're staying in these tents,114.87,1.44
36,"that are tucked into the mountainside,",116.31,1.56
37,"so it feels so immersive
and it's so quiet.",117.87,3.603

39,"which was one of the most
scenic drives of the trip.",126.12,3.21
40,"Every five minutes I wanted
to stop and take pictures",129.33,2.85

42,to visit Periyar National Park,133.53,2.01

46,"around the boat launch
and they're not shy.",141.03,2.07
47,You can sit just a few feet away from them,143.1,2.19
48,and take pictures.,145.29,1.421
49,(light upbeat music),146.711,3.083
50,"A boat safari is such a
great way to see wildlife.",151.05,2.61

52,"eventually come down
to the water to drink.",155.55,2.67
53,"So you have a chance
to see everything here.",158.22,1.8

cutest little cabin-like room",178.29,3.75
60,"with this beautiful

61,And here I'm going to be learning more,184.59,1.47
62,about the tea making process.,186.06,1.56
63,"And then this afternoon,",187.62,1.02
64,I'm going out on a jeep ride,188.64,1.41
65,to explore the property some more.,190.05,2.1
66,"So one of the experiences at
the Misty Mountain Experience",192.15,3.66
67,is a tea factory tour,195.81,1.53
68,so you can see how it's all made.,197.34,1.56
69,And one of the very basic things about tea,198.9,2.64
70,that I didn't know before this tour,201.54,1.71
71,is that both black and green tea,203.25,2.49
72,come from the same plant.,205.74,1.35
73,And it requires a specific temperature,207.09,1.98
74,"and humidity to thrive,",209.07,1.29
75,"which is what makes this
region and property so special.",210.36,3.51
76,"But something else that
makes the property incredible",213.87,3.21
77,is it's perched on a mountainside,217.08,1.86
78,with waterfalls running down it.,218.94,2.22

84,"I've ever done traveling,",238.017,1.893
85,"I'm staying on a private
houseboat tonight.",239.91,2.49
86,So it's just me and my guide,242.4,1.44
87,"and a few crew members
here to operate the boat",243.84,2.82
88,and cook and keep everything running.,246.66,1.98
89,"And it is so cool and it has
been so relaxing to sit here",248.64,4.544
90,"and drift through the back
waters and take in the scenery.",253.184,3.52
91,(light ethereal music),256.704,3.25
92,"The next day was the Champions
Boat League snake-boat races.",280.68,3.42
93,This event is an annual series of races,284.1,2.58
94,on the backwaters of Kerala,286.68,1.59
95,"with teams of rowers racing
these long skinny boats",288.27,2.91
96,called snake boats because of the shape.,291.18,2.1
97,And it's a big deal.,293.28,1.11
98,"People line the banks of
the backwaters for it.",294.39,3.5
99,(horns honking),297.89,2.667
100,One of the highlights of this day,305.786,1.624
101,was that one of the families,307.41,1.68
102,that live on the water,309.09,1.05
103,"invited me into their home for lunch,",310.14,2.28
104,and they were so kind.,312.42,1.868
105,It's traditional to eat everything,314.288,1.822
106,"with your hands in India,",316.11,1.17
107,even rice and sauce.,317.28,1.59
108,So they were coaching me on how to do it,318.87,2.46
109,and I think they found it kind of amusing,321.33,1.98
110,to see me try it for the first time.,323.31,2.01
111,"And it was just such a
wonderful experience.",325.32,2.944
112,(light upbeat music),328.264,3.083
113,I've made it to paradise.,338.28,1.68

staying at is kind of like",339.96,2.79
115,if a hotel and an Airbnb were mixed.,342.75,2.88
116,"I'm the only guest here,",345.63,1.41
117,"so I have the entire property to myself,",347.04,2.76
118,but there's also staff here.,349.8,1.86
119,"It's like a private stay,
it's called vismaya.",351.66,2.7
120,"And this outdoor shower
situation I have is amazing.",354.36,3.69
121,"Outside of my room,",358.05,0.87
122,I have a little private courtyard,358.92,1.68
123,with all of the bathroom things,360.6,2.13
124,and there's this rain shower.,362.73,1.38
125,"I came out here at like
9:00 PM last night.",364.11,3.15
126,It was like still 80 degrees,367.26,2.1
127,"and I stood under this shower,",369.36,1.53
128,and it was perfection.,370.89,1.5
129,If you've never stayed somewhere,372.39,1.32
130,"with a private outdoor shower like this,",373.71,2.22
131,"you need to add it to your bucket list,",375.93,1.29
132,but it needs to be somewhere tropical.,377.22,1.89
133,"I've stayed at places in the
desert with outdoor showers,",379.11,3.45
134,but it cools off so much at night,382.56,2.1
135,"that like in the early
morning or late at night",384.66,2.07
136,"when you would typically take a shower,",386.73,2.04
137,it's kind of too cold to be pleasant.,388.77,2.7
138,But when it's tropical and it's still warm,391.47,1.8
139,"at night or in the morning, it's amazing.",393.27,2.43
140,And then this morning I got up at sunrise,395.7,1.92
141,"and swam in the pool and I'm
just having the best time.",397.62,3.328
142,(light upbeat music),400.948,3.083
143,"Next, we drove to a spot nearby",409.95,1.95
144,for a village experience,411.9,1.56
145,where I got to visit some local homes,413.46,1.83
146,"and learn a little
about their way of life.",415.29,1.98
147,They showed me how they produce goods,417.27,1.71
148,"like woven palm shades,",418.98,1.56
149,"and I got to see how they fashioned ropes,",420.54,1.77
150,which was really incredible.,422.31,1.5
151,This took them less than a minute to make,423.81,1.59
152,"from a coconut husk, and it's so strong.",425.4,2.55
153,"Wow, that's incredible.",427.95,3.33
154,I also got to see this really cool,431.28,1.74
155,coconut tree climbing device.,433.02,1.83
156,"And then we headed to
the Marari beach resort",434.85,2.91
157,"on the ocean which is a
really beautiful property.",437.76,2.588
158,They also place a strong emphasis,440.348,2.032
159,on sustainable tourism.,442.38,1.56
160,And they have this tea cart,443.94,2.01
161,"where a woman makes
what's called meter chai,",445.95,2.97
162,because it's poured from a meter high.,448.92,2.4
163,And she was so good at this.,451.32,1.62
164,The resort is especially,452.94,1.17
165,known for its Ayurvedic medicine center.,454.11,2.13
166,"And of course, the beach.",456.24,1.32
167,"The sunset over the
Arabian Sea was incredible.",457.56,3.002
168,(light upbeat music),460.562,3.083

170,"I'm back where I started
in the city of Kochi.",468.06,2.79
171,"I didn't really know what to
expect before coming here.",470.85,2.28
172,"Actually, my guide and I
were talking about this.",473.13,1.62
173,"He said a lot of the world,
especially Americans,",474.75,2.43
174,"when they think of India,",477.18,0.9
175,"they just think of the Taj
Mahal and nothing else.",478.08,2.25
176,"Where in reality, it's
actually quite a large country",480.33,2.43
177,with a lot of other things in it.,482.76,1.56
178,"So I didn't come here
with a lot of expectations",484.32,2.28
179,"which is sometimes the best
way to experience a new place.",486.6,3.0
180,And I loved the scenery.,489.6,2.07
181,I loved the foggy mountainous hills,491.67,2.52
182,and the tranquil backwaters.,494.19,2.1
183,If you are planning a visit to Kerala,496.29,1.74
184,and you're interested in doing,498.03,1.74
185,"kinda like a road trip
through the state like I did,",499.77,2.52
186,"my number one tip would
be to book a guided tour.",502.29,3.9
187,"About an hour into the tour,",506.19,1.71
188,I realized there was no way,507.9,1.8
189,"I ever would've been able
to navigate it by myself.",509.7,3.09
190,"So definitely if you're
planning to come here",512.79,1.71
191,"and move around a lot, I
would totally do a tour.",514.5,3.12
192,"Thanks for coming along
